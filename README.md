# CharHashing
Collection of functions and classes that use a combination of mid-square method hashing, along with unicode code point representation, to hash strings. The main function of interest, charLoadFactorOptimizer, seeks to maximize the loadFactor of the hash table we return by returning once ever string we pass to the function is admitted entry into the hash table.
